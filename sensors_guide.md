In this page I'll show you how to build the various sensors required to play my Accessible Digital Musical Instruments.

# Netytar's Breath Pressure sensor

§ IMAGE COMING SOON

**Cost:** around 30€/35$, depending mostly on which microcontroller you choose;

**Components:** I've included links to sample components to take a look at them, but you can find them elsewhere on other shops, even at better prices.

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) microcontroller ([Uno](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3), [Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano), whatever. [Elegoo](https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-uno-r3-board) makes cheaper compatible chips);
- USB Type A to Type B cable (to connect Arduino to your PC. Often included with Arduino);
- [MPX 5010DP](https://www.conrad.com/p/nxp-semiconductors-pressure-sensor-1-pcs-mpx5010dp-0-kpa-up-to-10-kpa-print-1182870) low pressure sensor (or an equivalent 10Kpa low pressure sensor);
- At least 3 male to female (or female to female if you choose Ardino Nano) [jumper wires](https://www.microcenter.com/product/613879/inland-dupont-jumper-wire-20cm-3-pack) for microelectronics, to connect Arduino to the sensor;
- A 5mm wide rubber tube (you can find them at a DIY/Bricolage store, under irrigation);
- A short PVC tube, and a set of small compatible pipe junctions (to make changeable mouthpieces);
- A small (3x3cm) piece of cloth (you can cut it from an old t-shirt or something like);
- Strong insulating tape;
- (Optionally) a small box to contain Arduino and the pressure sensor.
