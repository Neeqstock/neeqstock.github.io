# Music

![Playing with friends](/images/cegnimusic.jpg){:width="300"}

I began playing the electric guitar when I was 16, and I have continued so far as self-taught. Now (age 29) I mostly play acoustic guitar.

During my life I experimented in composing music in various genres, having a preference for:

- Post-rock (mostly inspired by Godspeed 
  You! Black Emperor, Efterklang, This Will Destroy You, Thee Silver Mt. 
  Zion, Explosions in The Sky);
- Psychedelic rock (mostly inspired by Beatles, Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd, Tame Impala);
- Folk and Folk-Rock music (mostly inspired by Inti-Illimani, Mike Oldfield, Neil Young);
- Jazz music (totally inspired by Django Reinhardt and other Manouche artists);

You can hear some of my music on ![Soundcloud ](images/soundcloud_logo.png) [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/nicoladavanzo) or ![Bandcamp](images/bandcamp_logo.png) [Bandcamp](https://neeqstock.bandcamp.com/).

## Bands and groups

During my "career" as a guitarist I had some bands. I'll list them here, as a "tribute" to those good memories:

- **Amphibika** *[me, Nicolas Scapin]* - 
  Random rock music. I had the fortune of having a friend at my secondary 
  school who was playing the drums. We started recording some covers, 
  after some months of experience with our instrument. A very good way to 
  learn, which I would suggest to any beginner musician.
- **Stillbreach** *[me, Michele Rosa, Daniele Salomoni, Ivan Cominato, Nicola Melchionni, Vlad Corlade]* - Random rock-metal music. The first band with which I played "live", 
  in a friends party. Beautiful memories made of cellars, pizzas and 
  learning songs at the last moment.
- **Copperframe** *[me, Ambra Rosetti, Mattia Piasentin, Luca Milanesi]* - Heavy metal, Glam (Guns & Roses, R. J. Dio, Motley Crue...). My 
  first "serious" experience. Other good memories. Sadly we only had 3 
  live experiences.
- **Frantic** *[me, Andrea Mugavero, Paolo Balzarini, Emanuele Dirotti]* - Metallica tribute band. We only had one live experience. One and an 
  half: we had to play in a new live music venue, but the place was not in
   accordance with the law and the police stopped the event.
- **Golden Lions** *[me, Beatrice Ferrara, Matteo Barbieri, Riccardo Orfano, Emanuele Romano]* - Random rock (mostly Queen and Ligabue, but also Rainbow). Other good 
  memories. We played in a good place in Voghera (PV), and at the 18 years
   party of a friend.
- **Lunatic Moon** *[me, Valerio Borioli, Elena Beltrami, Marco De Santis, Elisa Cacciatore, Edoardo Fava, Martina Corrada, Marcello Magnani]* - Pink Floyd tribute band. My biggest music experience, which lasted 
  for more than 4 years. I had a lot of live experience with them (I'm not
   sure about how many, but at least 20 appearances).
- **Souls 4 Sale** *[me, Paolo Bollinella, Daniele Chiesa, Alessandro Marone, Edoardo Fava]* - Foo Fighters tribute band. A group of misfits put up to attend a live event.
