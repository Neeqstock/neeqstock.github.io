# Netytar

![Netytar](/images/netytar_comp.jpg){:width="300"}

Netytar is a software Accessible Digital Musical Instrument controlled by gaze pointing and breath. I developed it as part of my master thesis project in Università degli Studi di Pavia, then continued its development during my PhD at Università degli Studi di Milano.

It is suitable for musicians having a quadriplegic disability, since it can be played without using their hands.

It's a monophonic instrument (i.e. able to play only one note at each time).

## Mapping

Gaze pointing controls note selection. It is detected through an eye tracker, a sensor which detects eye features through infrared cameras.

Breath controls note dynamics through a low pressure sensor. Netytar can somewhat be compared to a digital flute in this sense.

## Sensors

Netytar is compatible with Tobii Eye Trackers such as [Tobii Eye Tracker 5](https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5/) (which have a cost of around 220€) or old, out of production Tobii 4C and Tobii EyeX.

Netytar's breath pressure sensor can be easily built DIY for under 30€.
